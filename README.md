# CleanSFML ðŸ‘”

It is a personal project based on the **C** library **CSFML**.

### .Goal ðŸŽ“

    The main goal is to add a lot of useful functions to make more easy game
    or UI development for the CSFML users.
    Feel free to contribute with some funny function such as:
    - Particles effects
    - Text effect
    - Light management
    - Enhanced collision effect
    - âœ¨
    Some examples are in the CleanTest folder to help user see how to use te functions.

### .USAGE

    Notice that for now the project is not in a package form.
    So the main way to use it is to compile the project with the source files themselves.
    You just have to include the *"clean_sfml.h"* in to your project.
    By the way you will not need to include the other common headers for the CSFML...
    Thanks to NemesisX1 ðŸ¤“.
